The Consensus Processing Pipeline
=================================

As part of the 2020 NMR in Biomed Special Edition on Spectroscopy, Near et al.
wrote a paper giving the consensus opinion on the post-acquisition processing
steps, at least for the single voxel case:

Near, J., Harris, A. D., Juchem, C., Kreis, R., Marjańska, M., Öz, G., et al. (2020). Preprocessing, analysis and quantification in single‐voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy: experts' consensus recommendations. NMR in Biomedicine, 29, 323–23. http://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4257

This is a highly worthwhile read for any spectroscopist, with excellent detail
on almost every component of the process, with the one notable exception of
channel combination.

Of course it is possible to perform all the processing steps from within
Suspect, here we provide a Jupyter notebook with the complete consensus
pipeline implemented.
